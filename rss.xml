The aching disrepair of its cities, the untamed foliage of its countryside, the orphaned coastlines - a half-century of isolation has wrapped the country in decay. Yet few places in the world brim with as much life as Cuba, a contrast drawn sharper amid its faded grandeur.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/fadd80fef63f3704329bd8f3effa0b99/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=548&cropwidth=1050&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F196de034f71ac2612a2898c9ace08482d0e1afa6.jpg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>3sixteen + Herman Miller</h1><p>LES-based raw denim fiends 3sixteen advocate skilled craftsmanship and longevity-which is why they often post photos of their customers' faded, worn-in jeans after years of use.
